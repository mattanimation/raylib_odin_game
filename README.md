# Raylib + Odin

A super basic example using Raylib and Odin together.

## Setup
I only have tested this on an older 2015 macbook pro. OSX-11.7.10

### Dependencies
- `brew install odin`

This requires llvm and raylib to be build locally, for this older laptop it took about 3 hours for it all to complete building and installing the dependencies.

## Build
-  `odin build .`

## Run
- `odin run .`
